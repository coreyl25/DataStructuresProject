# DataStructuresProject
Final Project for Professor Ali 
To compile and run code you must first ensure you have a smfl installed then compile by g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp Stack.cpp Queue.cpp Heap.cpp PriorityQueue.cpp RedBlack.cpp BTree.cpp AVL.cpp BST.cpp GUIManager.cpp -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -o visualizer && ./visualizer.

Breakdown on Menu
After compilation the ADTs will appear, you will be prompted to enter a number to select the ADT you wish to use. After you will be prompted to select an operation type. For example if you selected stack as your ADT your operation options will be Insert, Delete, Search, Visualize or Exit. If you select Visualize you must exit the program for any of the ADTs and recompile to go back to the other operation types. Visualize will display your ADT will all values as inputted. All steps will be explained in the terminal as well.
